# INTRODUCTION

In this assignment, I was tasked to write two essential shell scripts to automate common system administration tasks:

## Project 1:
## System Setup Scripts: 
In this script, I created 4 simple scripts to automate software installation and set up symbolic links to configuration files. 
My four scripts include:
List-packages
Install-packages
Config-app-files
call-scripts
This will simplify system configuration and ensure a consistent setup.

## Project 2:
## User Creation Script: 
In this script, there is automation to adding new users, setting passwords, assigning groups, creating home directories, and configuring shells.
This will help streamline user management and access control.

This assignment can strengthen my shell scripting skills, focusing on command-line options, error handling, and best practices in coding.
